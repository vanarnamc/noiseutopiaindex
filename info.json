This concept sought to bridge nature and technology, echoing Heidegger's views on technology as a mode of revealing, allowing the wind's inherent patterns to become audibly evident. However, technical limitations prevented precise detection of the harp strings' vibrations by wind, resulting in a redesigned installation that combined elements of sculpture, wind vane, wind chime, and equipment rack to capture wind patterns.",

This exploration of scent parallels their experiences in sound recording, highlighting the complexities and mysteries of both worlds.",

The result is a unique mixture of traditional African rhythms, dub and free jazz.\n\nFeatures DJ favourite “Stebeni’s Theme” and “Far Away Chant”, used to famously gruesome effect by David Lynch in the film Wild At Heart.\ncredits",

(In his liner notes, Ashley revealed that he suffered from 'a mild form of Tourette's.') The piece starts quietly, with scraps of Ashley's mild, tremulous voice arranged next to more fluid French translations and barely-there touches of Moog. After Ashley's phrases lengthen enough to encompass sense-making phrases, a bass-register groove briefly appears, vanishes, then returns. Few pieces so quiet have proven as captivating; many that intend to be equally startling can't capture Ashley's range of surprises.” -- Seth Colter Walls, from Pitchfork's \"Fifty Best Ambient Albums of All Time\"",

At the very start of her fragile career these recordings are nothing short of sacrificial ode to her mentor and machine, sonic pickets of the revolution and love letters to an absolutely genuine vision of and ‘alternative’ musical future. In denouncing her own precocious polymathmatic past in a bid to persuade the world to sing from a new hymn sheet, Suzanne Ciani created a bi-product of never before heard music that would render the pigeon holes “ambient” and “futuristic” utterly inadequate. Providing nothing short of an entirely different feminine take on the experimental “records” of Morton Subotnick and proving to a small, judgmental audience and jury the true versatility of one of the most radical and idiosyncratic musical instruments of the 20th century. These recordings have not been heard since then.",

      "description": "The People United is a set of 36 variations on the Chilean song \"¡El pueblo unido jamás será vencido!\" by Sergio Ortega and Quilapayún.\nThe song on which the variations is based is one of many that emerged from the Unidad Popular coalition in Chile between 1969 and 1973, prior to the overthrow of the Salvador Allende government. Rzewski composed the variations in September and October 1975, as a tribute to the struggle of the Chilean people against the newly imposed repressive regime of Augusto Pinochet; indeed the work contains allusions to other leftist struggles of the same and immediately preceding time, such as quotations from the Italian traditional socialist song \"Bandiera Rossa\" and the Bertolt Brecht-Hanns Eisler \"Solidarity Song.\"\n\nIn general, the variations are short, and build up to climaxes of considerable force. The 36 variations, following the 36 bars of the tune, are in six groups of six. The pianist, in addition to needing a virtuoso technique, is required to whistle, slam the piano lid, and catch the after-vibrations of a loud attack as harmonics: all of these are \"extended\" techniques in 20th-century piano writing. Much of the work uses the language of 19th-century romanticism, but mixes this language with pandiatonic tonality, modal writing, and even serial techniques.\n\nAs in the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach, the final variation is a direct restatement of the original theme, intended to be heard with new significance after the long journey through the variations.",

      "description": "With 4’33” Cage paved the way for works such as Young’s Composition 1960 pieces, which provide one of the basic foundations for the idea to serve as the artwork by itself, with no unnecessary embellishments. Central to Young’s work is the concept of “stasis,” as opposed to “Fluxus.” “Change or flux is inevitable,” Young wrote. “Stasis, or remaining the same, is impossible. Therefore, to achieve the static state is the goal, while the state of flux, variation, or contrast, is unavoidable and thus unnecessary as a goal.” Later, Composition 1960 pieces appeared alongside works by other artists in An Anthology (1963), edited by Young, a publication characterized as “chance operations, concept art, anti art, indeterminacy, . . . improvisation, meaningless work,” and “natural disasters.” In 1960 and 1961, together with Yoko Ono, Young organized a series of events at Ono’s loft on Chambers Street that had a germinative effect on the formation of Fluxus.\n",

      "description": "Vexations is a musical work by Erik Satie. Apparently conceived for keyboard (although the single page of manuscript does not specify an instrument), it consists of a short theme in the bass whose four presentations are heard alternatingly unaccompanied and played with chords above. The theme and its accompanying chords are written using enharmonic notation. The piece is undated, but scholars usually assign a date around 1893–1894 on the basis of musical and biographical evidence.\nThe piece bears the inscription \"In order to play the motif 840 times in succession, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, and in the deepest silence, by serious immobilities.\" (\"Pour se jouer 840 fois de suite ce motif, il sera bon de se préparer au préalable, et dans le plus grand silence, par des immobilités sérieuses.\") From the 1960s onward, this text has mostly been interpreted as an instruction that the page of music should be played 840 times,[1][2] although this may not have been Satie's intention.",

It consists of an upside down buried pot with a hole at the top. Water drips through the hole at the top onto a small pool of water inside of the pot, creating a pleasant splashing sound that rings inside of the pot similar to a bell or Japanese zither. It is usually built next to a traditional Japanese stone basin called chōzubachi, part of a tsukubai for washing hands before the Japanese tea ceremony.",
